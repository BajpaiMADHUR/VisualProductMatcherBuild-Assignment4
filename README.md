# VisualProductMatcherBuild-Assignment4
This project is a React.js-based Image Product Search Application, designed to make product discovery more intuitive through image search instead of traditional keyword-based queries. Deployed seamlessly on Vercel, the application delivers a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience directly from the browser.

TECH STACK
This project is built using the following technologies:

Frontend :
HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

CSS: A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of the web page.

JavaScript: A programming language that enables interactive web pages.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows us to create reusable UI components.

React Router DOM: Used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages without a full page reload.


Backend :
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run server-side code.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.

RESTful API: A set of rules that allows the frontend and backend to communicate with each other using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Database :
I have created a txt file in which more than 50 products with metadata are present, for a properly functioning application we can use MongoDB to provide a comprehensive and standard example of a modern web application's technology stack. It's a very popular choice for full-stack projects, especially with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, and its inclusion in the README provides a complete picture of a typical project's architecture.


DEPLOYMENT:
For deployment purpose, I have used Vercel which is a free deployment platform. It is used to host the application, making it accessible to the public. They automate the build and deployment process.
